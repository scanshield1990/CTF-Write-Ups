# 🎯 Capture the Flag (CTF) Writeups

This repository contains my writeups for various Capture the Flag challenges.  
Each writeup includes methodology, commands, screenshots, and lessons learned.  
The goal is to document my process — not just the flags — and to demonstrate practical problem-solving in cybersecurity.

## 🛠️ Methodology
Each writeup follows a standard flow:
1. **Recon** – Information gathering (Nmap, Gobuster, etc.)  
2. **Enumeration** – Digging deeper into discovered services  
3. **Exploitation** – Exploit research & execution  
4. **Privilege Escalation** – Gaining higher-level access  
5. **Lessons Learned** – What I’d do better next time
